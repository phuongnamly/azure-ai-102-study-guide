## Study guide
### Courses & Applied Skills
I spent around 2 weeks studying the [Microsoft Learn course](#courses). Completing the lab exercise at the end of each module to essential to reinforce the theory you just read. After I finished a learning path, I took the corresponding [applied skill assessment](#ai-applied-skills) to reinforce my practical skills and knowledge. As of June 2024, there is no applied skill assessment for knowledge mining yet.

### Exam Prep
After I finished the course, I did the official AI-102 Practice Assessment twice and completed the first 2 Scott Duffy's tests. The offical and Scott Duffy's practice exams covered the content well. You are also allowed to use Microsft Learn as the only resource during exam so you can practice how and where to search for information.

### Exam format
I had 100 minutes to complete 51 questions, 6 of which belong to a case study. ***A case study can be at the end of your questions so please save enough time to answer those questions.*** Once you enter the case study section, you cannot go back to the other non-case-study questions to change your answer. You are also allowed to use Microsft Learn as the only resource.

### Time management in exam
I tried to spend 1 minute 30 seconds per question, mark questions that I'm unure about as "For Review". I tried to save about 15-20 minutes for the case study. When I finished the first 45 questions, I still had about 20 minutes so I spent 5 minutes reviewing the questions that I marked as "For Review". Once there was 15 minutes left, I entered the case study section.

### Using Microsoft Learn in exam 
While the exam allows use Microsoft Learn to search for information, you should familiarize yourself with the content first to know where and how to search for information. Otherwise, you will run out of time if you have not gone through the exam content before.
